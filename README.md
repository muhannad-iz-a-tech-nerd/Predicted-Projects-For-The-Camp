# 🎯 Predicted Projects for the Camp

Welcome to the official repository for **predicted project builds** in preparation for the upcoming 5-day hackathon.

This repo is part of a proactive strategy to **gain early technical advantage** by prebuilding flexible, high-quality solutions based on common challenge themes from previous years and observed trends in hackathons.

Each day leading up to the event, a new prototype or mini-project will be added — modular, well-documented, and easily adaptable to various prompt modifications.

---

## 📅 Hackathon Countdown:
**Days remaining:** 9  
**Goal:** 10 versatile projects  
**Frequency:** 1 new project per day

---

## 🧠 Why This Repo?

- Speed up development by using pre-tested, plug-and-play modules  
- Refactor or repurpose code depending on challenge specifics  
- Minimize downtime on Day 1 with immediate building blocks  
- Avoid reinventing the wheel — instead, evolve it.
