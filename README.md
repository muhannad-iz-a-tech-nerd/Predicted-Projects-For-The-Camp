# 🎯 Predicted Projects for the Camp

Welcome to the official repository for **predicted project builds** in preparation for the upcoming 5-day hackathon.

This repo is part of a proactive strategy to **gain early technical advantage** by prebuilding flexible, high-quality solutions based on common challenge themes from previous years and observed trends in hackathons.

Each day leading up to the event, a new prototype or mini-project will be added — modular, well-documented, and easily adaptable to various prompt modifications.
